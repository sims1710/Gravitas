## Game Description
You crash-land on **Planet 300**, a desolate yet dangerous world. Your only way to survive is by reaching the settlement, but the terrain and hostile creatures stand in your way. Fortunately, your suit allows you to **manipulate gravity**, affecting not only yourself but everything around you. Navigate treacherous landscapes, fight off enemies, and make strategic use of gravity to progress through the planetâ€™s dangers.

- Players manipulate gravity to **traverse the environment** and **engage in combat**.
- Gravity affects movement, jumping, and object interactions.
- All objects around the player are also influenced by gravity, except for **checkpoints** and **alien enemies**.

## Game Procedure & Controls
- `A, D` â€“ Move character left or right
- `Left Mouse Click` â€“ Shoot
- `Right Mouse Click & Drag` â€“ Adjust gravity


- Players have **full control over gravity**, allowing them to experiment with movement, jumps, and enemy interactions in different ways.
- This freedom fosters engagement as they discover **creative solutions** to challenges.

## Game Balance Efforts
- **Risk vs. Reward:** The high-risk area offers a boss that, upon elimination, gives a score of **100 points** (unlike the usual **10 points**), rewarding players who take on challenges.
- **PvE Balance:** Enemy numbers **increase gradually**, with the **boss** being the final challenge.
- **Health Checkpoints:** Instead of restarting completely, **checkpoints refresh the life bar**, making progression manageable.

## Unique Rule
**Breaking a Conventional Rule:**
- Players **cannot directly control their jumps** as in traditional platformers.
- Instead, they must **manipulate gravity** to adjust their movement, adding a layer of strategy and skill.
